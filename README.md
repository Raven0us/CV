# CV

Node.js harmony + Express + mongoose + Angular

A minimal single-page CV that can display things based on a token you have previously created for a particular person. Nothing's hardcoded, all the data / chunks of text are retrieved from a database in order to be able to quickly modify things without having to commit each time you need to change something and to be able to automatically generate a PDF/DOC from that information.

# TODO
Design
Mongo migrations
Admin module with PDF/DOC (re)generation & token creation
